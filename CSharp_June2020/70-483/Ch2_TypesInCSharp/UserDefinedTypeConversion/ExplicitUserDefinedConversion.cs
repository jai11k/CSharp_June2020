    A user can define an explicit conversion definition in a type that helps to convert
    it into another type. Casting is required to convert a type into another.Data can be
    lost in explicit conversion.
    For explicit conversion, a special static method is defined with an explicit and
    operator keyword inside the type definition.

• returnType tells which type of data would get returned in implicit conversion.
• type t tells which type would get converted implicitly.
