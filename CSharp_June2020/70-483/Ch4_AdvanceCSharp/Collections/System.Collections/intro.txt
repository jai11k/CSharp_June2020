System.Collections is a namespace which contains classes and interfaces that manages
a group of data. It stores each data in the form of a system.object type. Therefore,
a group of value type data always gets boxed/unboxed. It defines multiple data structures
to store and retrieve data such as list, queue, and hashtable.

Class          Explanation
ArrayList      Array of objects whose size can grow and shrink dynamically 
Hashtable      Collection of key/value pair, organize on base of hash code 
Queue          Manages group of data in First In, First Out (FIFO) order 
Stack          Manages group of data in Last In, First Out (LIFO) order

ArrayList
It’s an array of objects which can grow and shrink its size dynamically. Unlike arrays,
an ArrayList can hold data of multiple data types. It can be accessed by its index.
Inserting and deleting an element at the middle of an ArrayList is more costly than inserting
or deleting an element at the end an ArrayList.

An ArrayList contains many methods and properties that help to manage a group of objects. The following is a list of some frequently used properties and methods defined in an ArrayList.
