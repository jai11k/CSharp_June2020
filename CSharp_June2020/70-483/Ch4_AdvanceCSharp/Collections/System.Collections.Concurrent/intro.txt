System.Collections.Concurrent namespace was introduced in .NET 4 framework. It provides
several thread- safe collections classes which protect a collection from being manipluated by
multiple threads. Collection classes that are defined in a System.Collections.Concurrent can
only be manipulated by a single thread. The .NET 4.0 Framework introduces several thread-safe
collections in the System.Collections.Concurrent namespace.


ConcurrentBag<T>               Represents a thread-safe, unordered collection of objects.
ConcurrentDictionary<T,V>      Represents a thread-safe collection of key-value pairs.
ConcurrentQueue<T>             Represents a thread-safe First In, First Out (FIFO) collection.
ConcurrentStack<T>             Represents a thread-safe Last In, First Out (LIFO) collection.


We’ll discuss more about System.Collections.Concurrent in Chapter 8: Multithread,
Async, and Parallel Programming.
