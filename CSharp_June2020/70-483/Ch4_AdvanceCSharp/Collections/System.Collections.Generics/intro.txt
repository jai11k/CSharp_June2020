System.Collections.Generics is a namespace which contains classes and interfaces to manage
a strongly-typed collection. In a generic collection, data cannot be boxed/unboxed because
data always gets type-safed. It is faster and better than classes and interfaces defined in
System.Collections. It also defines multiple data structures to store and retrieve data such
as List<T>, Queue<T>, Stack<T>, and Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.  

List<T>                  List of type-safe objects that can dynamically grow & shrink
Dictionary<Tkey,Tvalue>  Represents collection of type-safe keys and values Represents
Queue<T>                 First In, First Out collection of type-safe objects Represents
Stack<T>                 Last In, First Out collection of type-safe objects
